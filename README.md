### Ticket Booking Application using GO!

In this project I learnt about one of the youngest programming languages that is becoming more and more popular in the cloud engineering world, which is Go or also commonly known as Golang. 
<br>
This project is a very simple CLI application to learn the basics of Go.

### Get started :wave:
1. Download the correct version of GO from [here](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Install GO and setup <code>PATH</code> variable
3. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and make a new folder: <code> mkdir [app-name] </code> and change directory and open in IDE.

   Setup <code>code .</code> if haven't already :grin:
4. Clone the Repository from here using <code> git clone https://github.com/vedantpople4/TicketBookingApplication.git </code>
5. Run the files using <code> go run . </code>
